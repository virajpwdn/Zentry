# Zentry

## Overview

Zentry is a website I recreated as a learning exercise to deeply understand GSAP animations, motion-driven storytelling, and how engaging user experiences are built on the web. The goal of this project was to explore how animations, transitions, and 3D elements can guide users through a narrative rather than just decorate a page.

The project was built using React and TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS, and deployed on Vercel. I integrated GSAP for advanced timeline-based animations and focusing on smooth transitions, scroll-based effects, and immersive interactions.

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of animation performance, storytelling through motion, and building visually rich interfaces without compromising usability.
